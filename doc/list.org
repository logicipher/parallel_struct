#+title: How to implement list for parallel program
* List with lock, using mutex

To accomplish what a normal list can do, wwe need to implement the following interfaces:

+ modify
  - push_back :: add a new item at the end
  - push_front :: add a new item at the front
  - insert :: add a new item just behind the psecified position
  - pop_front :: pop up the first item from list
  - pop_back :: pop up the last item from the list
+ read
  - front :: access the first item
  - back :: access the last item
  - iterator :: use the iterator to access elements
+ meta data access
  - size :: get the number of elements
  - empty :: check whether the list is empty
